## ðŸŽ¯ Task Completed
**Option 2: Re-Identification in a Single Feed**

Track each player in a 15-second football video and ensure that each retains the same identity even after leaving and re-entering the frame.

---

## ðŸ§  Methodology

### 1. Detection
- Used the provided fine-tuned **YOLOv8** model (`yolo_model.pt`) for player and ball detection.
- Only class 0 (players) was used for re-identification.

### 2. Tracking
- Integrated `deep_sort_realtime` to assign and persist unique player IDs.
- The tracker uses motion + appearance features to maintain ID consistency.

### 3. Visualization
- Used OpenCV to draw bounding boxes and player labels (`Player <ID>`) on each frame.
- Final output video is saved as `outputs/tracked_output.mp4`.

## ðŸ§± Challenges

- No prior experience with YOLO or DeepSORT â€” had to learn basics on the go.
- Real-time video frame extraction, detection, and re-identification was completely new.
- Minor bugs while installing and referencing paths â€” resolved through experimentation.

---

## ðŸ”® Improvements (with more time)

- Better re-ID with jersey number or color embeddings.
- Improve ID persistence in cases of occlusion or tight player clusters.
- Expand to multi-camera (Option 1) using feature-based matching or tracklet linking.

---

## âœ… Summary

- Fully working pipeline for Option 2
- Player detection + re-identification achieved with minor issues with consistent IDs
- Code is modular, reproducible, and beginner-friendly
- Learned end-to-end basics of a real-world CV task from scratch
